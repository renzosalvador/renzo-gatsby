      <p>
        I have been in the industry for more than 16 years. I started as a
        Graphic Designer and Web Developer (which I still am). In the last 10
        years, I have been integrating Digital Marketing and SEO techniques into
        any Web Development or WordPress Project entrusted to me. }
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to my experience as a Web Developer, I can debug any user
        experience, web performance, web speed, or server issues that could
        occur on a Website.
